    "faq_para1": "XRP20 has been created in solidarity with the latest crypto market trend of giving second opportunities for people who missed out on successful legacy tokens.\n\nXRP rose from $0.0028 in 2014 to $3.84 in 2018, increasing 137,100% from its lowest to highest price. We’re hoping to provide a similar opportunity today with XRP20.",
    "faq2": "Why launch on Ethereum?",
    "faq_para2": "Restarting XRP20 as an ERC-20 token provides several benefits to buyers. Ethereum is the most used and secure blockchain with many decentralized wallet options, making it easy for buyers to store, track, and trade XRP20.",
    "faq3": "Is XRP20 connected to XRP?",
    "faq_para3": "No. XRP20 has no affiliation with XRP or any Ripple Labs products. This token is intended for experimental and entertainment purposes.",
    "faq4": "What is the token utility of XRP20?",
    "faq_para4": "The utility of XRP20 is being able to own the token at the lowest possible price and stake it to earn passive rewards. There is a deflationary feature in the smart contract that ensures 0.1% of every transaction is burned, while 10% of the supply is also set aside to be burned.",
    "faq5": "Is there a way to contact support?",
    "faq_para5": "Should you need assistance with anything, don’t hesitate to email contact@xrp20coin.com or ask a moderator in our Telegram group.",
